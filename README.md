# SimpleGraphs
SimpleGraphs is a small, user-friendly, header-only C++ library for creating and handling various types of graphs, and performing different algorithms on them.
The main goal of this library is to allow any type of data to be stored in graph nodes, similar to how STL data structures handle such operations.
Compile with C++17 or newer
