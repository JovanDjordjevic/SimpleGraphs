# SimpleGraphs
SimpleGraphs is a small, user-friendly, header-only C++ library for creating and handling various types of graphs, and performing different algorithms and operations on them. 
The main goal of this library is to allow various types of data  (both built in and user defined) to be stored in graph nodes and edges while implementing algorithms in the most generic way possible while also beeing easy to learn and use.

Compile with C++17 or newer.
